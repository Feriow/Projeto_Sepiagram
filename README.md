# Projeto_Sepiagram
This is a web development practice project (HTML and CSS) that consists of reproducing and customizing Instagram's login interface. The lessons were developed by Gabriela Pinheiro as part of Digital Innovation One's HTML Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Original project conclusion**: index_padrao.html e style_padrao.css.

**My version: Sepiagram**: index_sepia.html e style_sepia.css.


My personal touch to the project was the creation of the Sepiagram version with the following alterations to the original project:

- Used `span` insted of `a` tags;
- Added `hover` and `active` effects over links;
- New logo and phone image;
- Different color theme;
- Used CSS sepia filter effect over images;
- Added shadows to login button for elevated effect.
